## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosting Guide

For optimal performance and privacy, you can self-host the addon. We offer multiple deployment options:

> **Tip**
>
> Consider adding your own configurations for enhanced functionality

### üê≥ Docker Compose Deployment

Deploy using Docker Compose for a containerized solution:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pantelx/aiocatalogs.git && cd aiocatalogs
# Start Docker Compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The docker-compose.yml file is configured to use the pre-built image by default, making it the easiest deployment option. To modify the configuration, edit the docker-compose.yml file before running `docker-compose up -d`.

Verify the installation by visiting `http://localhost:8787/` in your browser. To customize the port or other settings, edit the Docker Compose file before starting the container.

> **Note**
>
> The Docker image is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for each push to the main branch and for each new version tag.

### üì¶ Source Installation

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is AIOCatalogs?

AIOCatalogs is an addon that combines multiple catalog addons into a single addon. It allows you to search and discover content from various sources in a single addon, without having to install multiple addons individually.

### How do I configure the addon server?

You can configure the addon server using environment variables:

1. **Port Configuration**: Change the default port (8787) by setting the `PORT` environment variable
2. **Cloudflare Configuration**: Configure the D1 database in the `wrangler.toml` file

For Docker deployments, the docker-compose.yml file is already configured to use the required environment variables.

### How do I add new catalog addons?

1. Open the addon's web interface at your installation URL
2. Click "Create New Configuration" to create a new user ID
3. Add catalog addons by entering their manifest URLs
4. Install the addon in Stremio using the displayed URL

1. Is the source addon correctly configured?
2. Is the source addon currently accessible?
3. Does the source addon offer the desired content at all?
